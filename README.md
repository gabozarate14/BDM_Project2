Where P1 represents what was done on the fist part of the project.

The tools used where `PySpark` for handling the data using directly `RDD's`, for transformations and for calculating some KPI's. Then 
some KPI's where exported into a `PostgreSQL` database to be then generate a dashboard using `Tableau`. And another set of KPI's where exported into 
`csv` files to then train and develop a small ML model.
